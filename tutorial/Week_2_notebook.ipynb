    "# Week 2: decoding analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's tutorial is about how to implement decoding analyses in Python. We'll be looking at the implementation of concepts like K-fold cross-validation, feature-selection/extraction, model fitting/prediction, permutation testing, and feature visualization. To do so, we'll use the [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning package in Python (the de-facto and most-used ML package in Python). In this tutorial, we'll use the PIOP-dataset (**P**opulation **I**maging **O**f **P**sychology), a large-scale (>240 subjects) multimodal MRI-dataset, including structural (gray-matter [VBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry) and white-matter [TBSS](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS)), resting-state (incl. [dual regression](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/DualRegression) data), and task-based functional data. Along with this set of MRI-scans, the PIOP-study also acquired a set of behavioral (psychometric) variables from various questionnaires and behavioral task (outside the scanner) of the same participants who were scanned. As such, this makes it an excellent data-set for decoding analyses in which you can use neural patterns (from any MRI modality; `X`) to predict a behavioral variable (`y`). This is, by the way, also one of the data-sets that you can use for your final project (more info on Blackboard/week_4).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll focus on a specific decoding analysis in which *we try to predict intelligence (y) from brain patterns (X) associated with working memory processing* (based on the same data as you practiced with in the tutorial of week 1). Throughout the tutorial, we'll discuss all the steps necessary to answer this research question. (Mini-ToThink: is this a within- or between-subject analysis?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of skills, after this tutorial you are be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load and appropriately transform dependent variables (`y`) corresponding to your patterns (`X`);\n",
    "* Apply basic preprocessing to your patterns;\n",
    "* Implement [feature-selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#feature-selection) and extraction processes;\n",
    "* Build fully cross-validated [pipelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html#sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline) using scikit-learn;\n",
    "* Run appropriate statistics (including permutation tests) on your model performance scores;\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, we do *not* cover feature visualization because it is quite complicated to implement, especially in combination with feature-selection. Also, \"brain mapping\" should not be your goal in decoding studies, anyway. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, in combination with the knowledge/skills you acquired from last week's tutorial, you'll be able to implement a complete decoding pipeline yourself at the end of this tutorial!"

    "### A note about standardization\n",
    "We briefly touched upon the issue of \"standardization\" last week, but the process of standardization is especially important in decoding analyses, so it warrants some extra explanation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained before, standardization refers to the process of converting numbers in a vector to the (signed) number of standard deviations it deviates from the mean of the vector. Formally, for a vector `x` with mean $\\bar{x}$ and standard deviation $s_{x}$ and length `N`, the standardized value of element $x_{i}$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x_{i} = \\frac{x_{i} - \\bar{x}}{s_{x}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, standardization in machine learning is applied to each column (i.e. feature), ensuring that each feature (in decoding: voxel) is on the same scale. In other words, standardization ensures that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But *why* do you have to standardize your features?\", you might reasonably ask. Well, that has to do with the way many ML models calculate their parameters (i.e. $\\beta$). For most models, this process may fail to converge and thus is unable to calculate the model's parameters if not all features are on the same scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, just remember that *before you do any model fitting* your features should be standardized\\*. Fortunately, you already implemented this yourself last week as a method in your mvp-class: the `standardize()` method! So, before we go on, let's just standardize our features:\n",

Just go to your desktop, double-click \"Files\", go up one directory (to `/home`) and go to `/home/Public/FirstLevel_piop`. Scroll aaaall the way down (past all the pi\\* folders) and you'll find a file called `PIOP_BEHAV_NIPA.tsv` file. Double-click this, and press \"Display\".

    "In some scenario's you might want to recode your continuous dependent variable (y) into a categorical one. One reason is simply because fMRI patterns are incredibly noisy, and classification analyses are more robust than regression analyses. Note, though, that if you recode your continuous DV into a categorical one, your conclusions about your model also become weaker: regression models allow you to explain/model variance across a larger interval than classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, would you be more impressed if told you I could predict your IQ with an error of +/- 2 points (a continuous DV) or if I told you I could only predict whether your IQ is higher or lower than 100 (a categorical DV)? Given that your dependent variable is truly continuous, it's better to subject it to a regression analysis in terms of strength of your conclusion, but given the very noisy nature of fMRI data it may be advantageous to trade in some of this inferential strength for some extra SNR by recoding your DV into a categorical variable. \n",
    "\n",

    "But how should we recode our DV? There are various ways to do this, but we'll use the median-split: any values above the median of `y` will be coded as 1 and any values below the median of `y` will be coded 0. Thus, our updated decoding goal is to predict whether someone has a high intelligence (`y = 1`) or low intelligence (`y = 0`).  \n",

In fact, everytime it is included in the train-set (90%, so 90 trials), it messes up the fit of the model so badly, that it always leads to chance-level predictions on the test-set (on average only 5 samples in the test set are predicted correctly). When this noisy sample is included in the test-set, however, it doesn't mess up the model fit, and on average the test-set is predicted correctly with 80% accuracy. \n",

Well, as the term \"permutation\" suggest, we can simply randomly shuffly the train-labels (`y_train`) to generate random labels. Now, if we would fit the classifier on {`X_train`, and `y_train`}, then practically it would fit on noise. In fact, by random shuffling of the train-labels, we simulated the scenario in which (on average) the null-hypothesis would be true.\n",
